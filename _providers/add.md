There is two ways to add new streaming service provider to Avacia

## Pay for it


I can add new provider for you. Contact me via [Telegram group](https://t.me/avacia_app)

## Do it yourself

For that you need to understand how JavaScript and CSS works. You can look at current integrations at [Avacia source](https://github.com/apla/avacia/blob/master/app/configured-sites.js). Better tutorial coming.
