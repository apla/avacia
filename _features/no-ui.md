Avacia is a technology preview, written by one person. I don't have resources to design beatiful apps, so you should like design of Netflix, if you're going to watch movies on Netflix. Or you can send message to Netflix to make special version for Avacia.

With music it's a little more complicated. In my opinion, proper music player should contain browser and search engine with recommendations (and everyone does this). But for really good experience I need something more:

 1. mini player with current playlist;
 2. micro player with just album picture;
 3. keyboard shortcuts to like, skip and dislike;
 4. option to continue play when my computer is locked (at a party);
 5. option to stop play when my computer is locked (don't want to return from bed to stop the music);
 6. pause music when headphones detached.

I would like to invest more time into this.
