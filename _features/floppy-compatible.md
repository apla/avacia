Avacia using system framework for rendering contents.

[Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) monopolized browser market. [Electron](https://electronjs.org) monopolized market of HTML/JavaScript apps. Monopolization means worse customer experience. With Electron apps you're paying extra by your computer resources for excessive disk and memory usage.

Take a look at short list of Electron-based players:

 1. [Amazon Music](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16962657011)
 2. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/)
 3. Soundcloud have no official app, but here is unofficial ones: [SoundCleod](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod), [Auryo](https://auryo.com)

Apple and Microsoft not much better as a corporations. But for HTML/JavaScript applications we can use system frameworks which shares software frameworks, thus disk and RAM space with another applications in operating system. It's slightly harder than stamping apps using Electron, but possible thanks to WebKit rendering engine now used in every OS.
