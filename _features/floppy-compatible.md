Avacia uses system framework for rendering contents.

[Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) has monopolized the browser market. [Electron](https://electronjs.org) has monopolized the market of HTML/JavaScript apps. Monopolization means worse customer experience. With Electron apps you're paying extra by your computer resources for excessive disk and memory usage.

Take a look at the short list of Electron-based players:

 1. [Amazon Music](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16962657011)
 2. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/)
 3. Soundcloud has no official app, but here are some unofficial: [SoundCleod](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod), [Auryo](https://auryo.com)

Apple and Microsoft are not much better as corporations, but for HTML/JavaScript applications we can use system frameworks which share software frameworks, thus disk and RAM space with another applications in operating system. It's slightly harder than stamping apps using Electron, but possible thanks to WebKit rendering engine now used in every OS.
