Use TV to watch family content. Use iPad for personal things. Phone is for music. Speaker with home assistant for music too. Buy gadget for every use case. Replace them regularly.

I'm using computer to do my job, my pet projects. While media players and especially music players evolved in the past years with all those new devices, desktop ones are mostly the same: iTunes (now Music) and Winamp.

Avacia main use case is to display video in window. Window will change height to preseve video aspect ratio. You can use shortcut to resize video window to 1/3 or 1/4 of screen. Music support available as «wny not?» principle.

If you want fullscreen, just use your TV or iPad. I've tried to add support for full screen, but failed.
