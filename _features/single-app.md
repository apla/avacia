Avacia can support any web player. So far only several major providers are supported. Support for yours is [probably coming soon](/new-service/).

Media is a special. Humans usually browse media one at a time. It is unlikely that you can watch videos and listen to music at the same time. Or listen to three music tracks, one per ear.
