Avacia is written using JavaScript. And already fixes things for sites using JavaScript.

Unlikely the Avacia author is going to add ads-skipping techniques, but you can! I'm really open to suggestions how to add **optional** ads skipping.

While you are planning and implementing ads skipping, please consider paying part of my ad-free media experience by donating.
