To download, just get the latest version from the project's releases page on GitHub.

[Avacia releases](https://github.com/apla/avacia/releases/)

macOS will complain about unknown developer and refuse to launch Avacia. I recommend the following steps to run application:

  1. move Avacia.app into Applications folder;
  2. right-click on Avacia.app;
  3. click `Open` menu item in the context menu;
  4. click `Open` button.

I predict sometime in the future Avacia.app will be notarized and available in the App Store. And this page will disappear as a puff of smoke.
