# Why Avacia

Avacia is a misspelled «ovacio», when people are clapping hands for performing artists. I've started working on Avacia in 2020 during lockdown, when we could not have any live performances.

Its second meaning is a belarussian word «Авацыя», which means the same, but with belarussian flavour. In 2021 it was 10 years since the dictatorship regime in Belarus made clapping outlawed as a form of people protest.
