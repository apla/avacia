# Why Avacia

Avacia — that a misspelled «ovacio», when people clapping hands for performing artists. I've started working on Avacia in 2020, on lockdown, when we cannot have any live performances.

Second meaning is a belarussian word «Авацыя», which means the same with belarussian taste. In 2021 passed 10 years after dictatorship regime in Belarus make clapping outlawed as a form of people protest.
